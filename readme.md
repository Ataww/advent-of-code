Advent of code
==============
2018 Edition

See https://adventofcode.com/2018

My solutions in Typescript along with template projects to get started on each problem. Navigate to the desired day and run `npm install` or `yarn` to install dependencies. If your input is different from mine replace the content of input.txt with your own.

## scripts

* __build__ - Build the program into a runnable nodejs file.
* __advent__ - Run the solution (must be built before).
